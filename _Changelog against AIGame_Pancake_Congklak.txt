1. Change min-max agent into lighter and simpler, alpha-beta pruning
2. Delete another puzzle and unused algorithm (A*, GREEDY, DFS)
3. Enhance the board into changeable board (Cover various region games)
4. Define best depth 
5. Try to integrate variance changing to agent
6. Add Reinforcement Learning (Q) to create dataset
7. If the pattern have been played before, agent will get from dataset instead of do min-max
